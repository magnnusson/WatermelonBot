# WatermelonBot
Upon request of a friend, a bot that will send a random picture of watermelons upon noticing the word "watermelon" in a Discord channel's chat. Absolutely useless. Though it was fun to dip my toes in bot making.

It will choose images found in the directory of the program meaning your own images will need to be used. A way this can be improved is to scrape images off the web and display them.
